harlequins director of rugby conor o'shea believes it is only a matter of time before marland yarde is restored to the england fold .
yarde excelled in saturday 's roller-coaster aviva premiership victory over gloucester , scoring the crucial try in the 70th minute at the stoop .
the 22-year-old wing won the last of his seven caps as a replacement last autumn , but was overlooked by england throughout the rbs 6 nations .
