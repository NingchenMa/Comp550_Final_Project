blue bell ice cream announced friday that it has suspended operations at an oklahoma production facility that officials had previously connected to a foodborne illness linked to the deaths of three people .
last month , the company and health officials said a 3-ounce cup of ice cream contaminated with listeriosis was traced to a plant in broken arrow , oklahoma .
the now-recalled ice cream product - cups of chocolate , strawberry and vanilla - is not sold in retail locations and is shipped in bulk to ` institutional accounts ' such as hospitals in 23 states that comprise less than 5 per cent of the company 's sales .
