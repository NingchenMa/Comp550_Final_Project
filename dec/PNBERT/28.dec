thiago -lrb- right -rrb- heads in bayern munich 's first goal during their 6-1 win over porto on tuesday night .
it 's probable that thiago alcantara would never have signed for manchester united even if david moyes had wanted him . once pep guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at bayern munich , it was pointless for united to continue their pursuit anyway , .
thiago is congratulated on his strike by pep guardiola , the man who took him from barcelona to bayern .
