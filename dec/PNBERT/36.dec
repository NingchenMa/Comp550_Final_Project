a virulent strain of bird flu continues to hammer the midwest and the virus recently took its biggest toll yet after it hit a farm in iowa that held nearly 10 percent of the state 's egg-laying chickens .
but the u.s. department of agriculture said monday that the h5n2 bird flu virus had been found at a farm in northwest iowa 's osceola county - prompting a massive bird cull .
seven other midwestern states have also been hit by the virus , dooming nearly 7.8 million turkeys and chickens since march .
