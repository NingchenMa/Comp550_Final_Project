cnn 's dr sanjay gupta has abandoned his journalistic duties to scrub up and perform brain surgery on a teenager in an overstretched hospital in nepal .
the neurosurgeon , who is in kathmandu to cover the aftermath of saturday 's deadly earthquake , performed a craniotomy on the 15-year-old girl , sandhya chalise , after a wall of her family 's home fell on her as she collected water outside .
more than 4,300 people are believed to have been killed in the earthquake , but nepalese officials have speculated that as many as 10,000 could have died .
