media personality miranda devine has apologised after calling a rugby player a ` tosser ' for celebrating a try using sign language .
flanker david pocock scored a hat-trick of tries for australian super rugby team , the brumbies , who were on their way to a win against the highlanders at canberra stadium on friday night .
but unfortunately for devine , it was n't actually the hand shaking gesture that 's become popular recently - the flanker and former australian captain was actually doing sign language for a friend , which pocock pointed out in reply .
