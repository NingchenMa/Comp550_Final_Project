men , women and children who boarded a united express flight from kansas city , missouri , to denver , colorado , were instead diverted to colorado springs due to bad weather .
the 6am flight took just an hour and a half to get to the unscheduled stop at colorado springs - but then languished for another six hours , before everybody was ordered off anyway .
