unlikely to face charges in california anytime soon : robert durst , 71 , pleaded not guilty thursday to two state gun charges in louisiana in a case that would delay his extradition to la to face murder charges . durst is pictured here last month in new orleans .
durst entered his plea during an arraignment in a new orleans court on weapons charges that accused him of possessing a firearm after a felony conviction and possessing both a firearm and an illegal drug , marijuana .
durst 's hands were shackled to his sides , and two defense attorneys lifted him from an armchair to his feet to walk to the podium .
